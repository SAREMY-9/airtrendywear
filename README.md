# This is an e-commerce project
# That's basically selling fashion items
# This code is the frontend bit of it.
# The backend was done separately as as the project continued to grow. 
# It included more and more of client details so I couldn't upload the whole of it publicly.
# But I'm willing to share how it all works aside from anything that's already on the user  interface.
# It consists of different pages where there are different functionalities.
# The JS ws basically vanilla.
# The css was as raw as it came
# Feel free to interact with the program and whenever you feel like you can make any more contribution don't hesitate to reach out to me.
